# terruino
ESP8266 based terrarium/aquarium controller with TFT screen and access by MQTT.

Includes:
*GUI TFT Screen for status of the connection, temperature, humidity warnings and the current readings.
*Switching relays based on MIN/MAX temperature/humidity values for heating or cooling.

WARNING!
TERRUINO NOW IS WORKING ONLY IN OFFLINE MODE
As I'm working on MQTT connection, this code is "commented" so you need to change it for yourself to work.
At the end of the Terruino_0_0_1a.ino you can find depreceated code for HTTP POST/GET connection, now i'm trying to learn how to connect by MQTT protocol, so use at own discretion.
